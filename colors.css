/* Question from Maja regarding the "find a nicer colour" task:

Shouldn't all colours be here, rather than also being defined in tokens.css?
I see that the value of mossgreen is used in tokens but not the actual variable.
Might be specifically intended as an open-ended task, but at least for me, it
is a bit confusing (out of any actual pedagogical context, mind you!!) Perhaps
we could turn this into a tiny "where you use a value more than once, consider
a variable" exercise? Or is that overkill?

I also thought it might be cool to let the kids define their own variables here,
choosing their own colours and names; what do you think?

/* Example task 1

This file is a bit emptier than it should have been by this point 😅 Instead of defining colour
variables in THIS file and using them when defining colour variables in tokens.css, I used
colour ✨ values ✨ when defining variables in tokens.css. Can you help me out by replacing
my use of colour values with the variables defined below?

BONUS: if you're feeling fancy, go ahead and experiment with creating your own custom colour
variables here and using them in tokens.css! 👩‍🎨
